# The EPICS environment variable EPICS_CA_MAX_ARRAY_BYTES needs to be set to a value at least as large
# as the largest image that the standard arrays plugin will send.
# That vlaue is $(XSIZE) * $(YSIZE) * sizeof(FTVL data type) for the FTVL used when loading the NDStdArrays.template file.
# The variable can be set in the environment before running the IOC or it can be set here.
# It is often convenient to set it in the environment outside the IOC to the largest array any client 
# or server will need.  For example 10000000 (ten million) bytes may be enough.
# If it is set here then remember to also set it outside the IOC for any CA clients that need to access the waveform record.  
# Do not set EPICS_CA_MAX_ARRAY_BYTES to a value much larger than that required, because EPICS Channel Access actually
# allocates arrays of this size every time it needs a buffer larger than 16K.
# Uncomment the following line to set it in the IOC.
